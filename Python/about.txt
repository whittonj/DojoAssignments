pip install Django 1.11.9  - installs a packacge named Django of that version
pip lsit shows all installed packages
pip install Django==1.11.9 - shows that requirement is satisfied since it's already isntalled
pip freeze - shows all the packages installed by pip but not editables.
The file shows the versions and installed packages by pip. From what I understan it can use this info to find other dependent files
uninstall - uninstalls the files associated 
pip search flask - shows all the modules associated with flask you can download
